	\section{Our Subfield}
	\cite{YangEA2018}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What did they do: \newline
		Built a simulation model to study impact of electric vehicles on the power grid
		\item Relevance: \newline
		Implementation of multiplex network of road/power 
		\item Notes: \newline
		paper is very sparse on math and details 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Power Grid}
	\cite{GuikemaEA2010}
		\begin{itemize}
		\item What did they do: \newline
		Built a GLM to predict damage to power grid elements based on information about hurricane
		\item Relevance: \newline
		Relevant to inventory prepositioning analysis \newline
		maybe useful for inclusion of crew predetermining in recovery model
		\item Notes: \newline
		I need to brush up on data mining techniques if I want to start using methods from this paper
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Road Grid}
	\cite{WinklerEA2010}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What did they do: \newline
		Did damage modeling and analysis of real-geography power grids in Texas subjected to hurricanes
		\item Relevance: \newline
		Handles dual Road/Power networks \newline
		Handles last mile distribution by tying load to closest substation 
		\item Notes: \newline
		May be worth contacting them to see if we can get their data
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Hurricanes}
	\cite{OuyangEA2014}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item What did they do: \newline
	Defined Resilience and recovery for hurricanes on power grids
	\item Relevance: \newline
	Information about damage rates of various grid elements \newline
	Basic "real world" rules for status quo repair scheduling 
	\item Notes: \newline
	more focused on social impact and talks about multiple infrastructure layers as a thing that needs to be considered.
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Other}
	\cite{SvendsenEA2007}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item What did they do: \newline
		Built a framework for handling multi-layer dependencies in infrastructure networks
		\item Relevance: \newline
		Any inclusion of dependent networks will need this 
	\end{itemize}
