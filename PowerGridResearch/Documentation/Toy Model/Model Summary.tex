\section{Variable Glossary}
$A$ is the set of nodes in the multigraph
\newline
$D$ is the constant matrix of shortest path travel costs from row location i to column location j
\newline
$L_i$ is the decision variable representing whether or not the supply depot is located at $i \in A$
\newline
$P$ is the set of parts to be stocked in order to repair grid elements
\newline
$h_i$ is the cost of stocking excess of part i  
\newline
$s_i$ is the cost of stocking out of part i
\newline
$C$ is the set of scenarios to be optimized over
\newline
$d_{ic}$ is the demand of part i in scenario c 
\newline
$q_i$ is the stock quantity of part i
\newline
\section{Math Model}

$$minimize \sum_{c \in C} ( \sum_{a \in A} \sum_{i \in A} D_{ia}L_i + \sum_{p \in P} h_p(max(q_p-d_{pc},0))+\sum_{p \in P} s_p(max(0,d_{pc}-q_p)))$$

subject to
\newline
$ q_i > 0$ \hspace{4pt}  $\forall i \in P$
\newline
$L_i \in (0,1)$
\newline
some budget constraint?
\newline
some part size/inventory size constraint? 

\section{Comments}
I'm unsure if inventory size is a necessary constraint since inventory holding areas can usually be expanded if it's going to be necessary. Maybe treat it as a cost to do so
\newline
I need to figure out multiple depots still, but that's on the to-do list.
