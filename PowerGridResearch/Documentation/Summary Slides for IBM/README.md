The is a template and style file for LaTeX Beamer for creating presentations.  The style file conforms to the [Visual Guidelines](http://www.engr.utexas.edu/communications/visualguidelines) provided by the [The University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu) [Cockrell School of Engineering](http://www.engr.utexas.edu).

The templates were designed to closely match the MS PowerPoint templates provided by the Cockrell School and artistic design credit is given to the original designers.  The template provides vector graphics descriptions in TikZ for the Cockrell School workmark, Ramshorn, and the UT-Austin wordmark which all have their respective trademarks. If you are not affiliated with the Cockrell School, contact [Amelia Johnson](mailto:amelia.johnson@austin.utexas.edu), Cockrell School Art/Design Manager, to obtain permissions to use these logos. 

The file `presentation.tex` shows a basic example with internal comments of how to use the options provided by the template.  There is no way I have covered all use cases so pull requests are welcome.

A `.latexmk` file is also provided for those who use `latexmk` to build LaTeX projects.  The template should be compatible with both `pdflatex` and regular `latex`.
