	abstract="The relationship between the symmetric traveling-salesman problem and the minimum spanning tree problem yields a sharp lower bound on the cost of an optimum tour. An efficient iterative method for approximating this bound closely from below is presented. A branch-and-bound procedure based upon these considerations has easily produced proven optimum solutions to all traveling-salesman problems presented to it, ranging in size up to sixty-four cities. The bounds used are so sharp that the search trees are minuscule compared to those normally encountered in combinatorial problems of this type.",

The characterization and modeling of these systems has proved amenable to treatment using techniques drawn from statistical and computational physics, and has as a result attracted considerable attention in the physics literature in recent years. In this paper the author reviews some of the interesting issues in this area and recounts some recent work on these issues by himself and by others."
