abstract={Natural disasters like hurricanes, floods or earthquakes can damage power grid devices and create cascading blackouts and islands. The nature of failure propagation and extent of damage, among other factors, is dependent on the structural features of the grid, that are distinct from that of random networks. This paper analyzes the structural vulnerability of real power grids to impending disasters and presents intuitive graphical metrics to quantify the extent of topological damage. We develop two improved graph eigen-value based bounds on the grid vulnerability. Further we study adversarial attacks aimed at weakening the grid’s structural robustness and present three combinatorial algorithms to determine the optimal topological attack. Simulations on power grid networks and comparison with existing work show the improvements of the proposed measures and attack schemes.},

abstract = "Optimization modeling has become a powerful tool to tackle emergency logistics problems since its first adoption in maritime disaster situations in the 1970s. Using techniques of content analysis, this paper reviews optimization models utilized in emergency logistics. Disaster operations can be performed before or after disaster occurrence. Short-notice evacuation, facility location, and stock pre-positioning are drafted as the main pre-disaster operations, while relief distribution and casualty transportation are categorized as post-disaster operations. According to these operations, works in the literature are broken down into three parts: facility location, relief distribution and casualty transportation, and other operations. For the first two parts, the literature is structured and analyzed based on the model types, decisions, objectives, and constraints. Finally, through the content analysis framework, several research gaps are identified and future research directions are proposed."

abstract = "This paper focuses on the planning of road restoration efforts during disaster response and recovery. The primary objective is to maximize network accessibility for all locations in the area during the restoration process so that survivors are evacuated and road side debris is removed as soon as possible. We propose a dynamic path based mathematical model that identifies criticality of blockages and clears them with limited resources. This model is more efficient than link based models and can solve restoration problems for realistic size networks within reasonable time. Algorithm performance is demonstrated using two instances based on districts in Istanbul."
