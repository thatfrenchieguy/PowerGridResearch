abstract="It is believed that almost any pair of people in the world can be connected to one another by a short chain of intermediate acquaintances, of typical length about six. This phenomenon, colloquially referred to as the ``six degrees of separation,'' has been the subject of considerable recent interest within the physics community. This paper provides a short review of the topic.",
