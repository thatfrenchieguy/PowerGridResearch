	\section{Introduction}
	Recently disaster response and resilience has been the "hot field" in logistics and planning. There has been a concentrated effort to study several aspects such as power grid islanding (cite 2-3 things), humanitarian supply management (cite 2-3 things), and systems repair (cite 2-3 things). Many of these project miss interactions between the solutions of multiple different infrastructure systems such as the road grid being necessary to move supplies for the power grid's repair.
