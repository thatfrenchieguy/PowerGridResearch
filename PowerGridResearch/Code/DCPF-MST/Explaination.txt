What's What:

Road First Iterative--solve the road problem then solve the full DCPF based power problem
NoTravelTime -- solve the power problem only with teleporting crews
RoadFirstContinuousShed--a test of linear load shedding rather than binary--not useful
DamagedGridCalculator--solves lost load on a damaged DC Powerflow grid
ModelGPY--just the road model
.gml files--network information
anything with 57 afterwards uses bus 57 rather than bus 30 netowrk
PostProcessor--converts input schedule to feasible schedule

Everything else is old or test files and can be safely ignored
